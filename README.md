## Evolution-of--Hearing-Thresholds
Application of longitudinal data analysis methods to investigate the evolution of hearing thresholds

## Background of study:
 This study concerns the application of longitudinal data analysis methods of a continuous outcome taken at unfixed and/or unequally spaced time points leading to unbalanced design. The outcome is the measurements of hearing thresholds (in dB), measured at a frequency of 500 Hz, of 1000 Hz, for the averaged over both ears (left and right).
 
## Objectives:
The study objective is to investigate the evolution of hearing thresholds and how these evolutions depends on age, by application of methods such as Summary Statistics, Multivariate, TwoStage and Random Effects analysis.

## Methodology:
Different methods to identify the evolution of hearing thresholds over time and the effect of age were used: summary statistics, multivariate model, two-stage models and a random-effects model. 

## Code:
The software used to generate the codes for the analysis is SAS 9.4.
